# UI Backup - Original Version

This backup was created before implementing the Figma UI design.

## Files Backed Up:
- `streamlit_app_backup_original_ui.py` - Complete backup of the original UI

## To Restore Original UI:
```bash
cp streamlit_app_backup_original_ui.py streamlit_app.py
```

## Current UI Features (as of backup):
- Simple, clean Streamlit default UI
- Two-column layout (text on left, visuals on right)
- Sidebar with controls, Instagram posting, and analytics
- No custom CSS or advanced styling
- Standard Streamlit components (st.subheader, st.write, etc.)

## Date of Backup:
December 30, 2024

## Notes:
- This is the "original" UI that was working before any Figma design implementation
- All functionality is preserved in this backup
- Safe to revert to this version at any time
